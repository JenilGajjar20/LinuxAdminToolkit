# Configuration Files

Welcome to the Configuration Files section of the LinuxAdmin Toolkit! This section provides detailed information on various configuration files in Linux. This guide will help you learn how to edit, manage, and understand the essential configuration files that control the behavior of the system.

Configuration Files in Linux are plain text files used to configure the operating system and applications. They are located in the `/etc` directory and in user home directories as dotfiles (e.g.: `.bashrc`)
