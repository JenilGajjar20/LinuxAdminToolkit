# Basic Shell Script Structure

## Shebang

- Every shell script starts with a shebang (`#!`) followed by the path to the interpreter.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

## Hello World Script

- We can save this as `hello.sh`, make it executable with `chmod +x hello.sh`, and then run it with `./hello.sh`.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, World!"
```
