# Services

Welcome to the Networking section of the LinuxAdminToolkit! This section covers various aspects of managing and configuring services on a Linux system. Services are essential components of Linux, enabling the system to perform tasks such as running web servers, databases, and other background processes.

In Linux, services are managed using various tools depending on the distribution and the init system used (e.g.: Systemd, Upstart, SysVinit).
